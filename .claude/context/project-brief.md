# Project Brief

## Project Overview
Claude Code PM is a comprehensive project management system specifically designed for AI-assisted development workflows using Claude Code. It transforms traditional software development processes through specification-driven development, parallel execution, and full traceability.

## Problem Statement
Modern software development teams face critical challenges:
- **Context Loss**: Project context evaporates between sessions, forcing constant re-discovery
- **Sequential Bottlenecks**: Traditional workflows force serial task execution, creating delays
- **Specification Drift**: Verbal decisions override written specifications, leading to inconsistencies
- **Progress Invisibility**: Stakeholders can't see progress until the very end of development cycles

## Solution Overview
Claude Code PM addresses these challenges through a systematic approach:

### Core Innovation: Specification-Driven Development
Every line of code must trace back to a specification through a strict 5-phase discipline:
1. **Brainstorm** - Think deeper than comfortable
2. **Document** - Write specs that leave nothing to interpretation
3. **Plan** - Architect with explicit technical decisions
4. **Execute** - Build exactly what was specified
5. **Track** - Maintain transparent progress at every step

### Key Differentiator: Parallel Agent System
Single issues decompose into multiple parallel work streams:
- Database agents handle schemas and migrations
- Service layer agents implement business logic
- API agents create endpoints and middleware
- UI agents build components and forms
- Test agents ensure quality and documentation

All running simultaneously in the same worktree, coordinated through Git commits.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- PRD creation and management system
- GitHub Issues integration and synchronization
- Parallel agent execution framework
- Context preservation across sessions
- Complete audit trail from requirements to code
- Command-based interface for Claude Code

### Out of Scope
- Custom project management UI (uses GitHub natively)
- Separate database systems (uses GitHub as source of truth)
- Team communication platforms (integrates with existing tools)
- Code hosting (uses existing GitHub repositories)

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- ✅ System installs and initializes successfully
- ✅ GitHub integration works without issues
- ✅ Parallel agents execute without conflicts
- ✅ Context preservation functions correctly
- ✅ Full traceability maintained from PRD to code

### Business Success
- 89% reduction in context switching time
- 3x faster feature delivery on average
- 75% reduction in bug rates through detailed task breakdown
- 5-8 parallel tasks vs 1 previously
- Zero specification drift through strict requirements traceability

### User Adoption
- Teams use system for all new features
- GitHub integration becomes primary project tracking method
- Parallel execution widely adopted for complex features
- Context preservation becomes standard practice

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Complete)
- Basic directory structure and scripts
- GitHub CLI integration
- Command framework
- Basic context management

### Phase 2: Workflow Implementation (Complete)
- PRD creation and parsing
- Epic generation and decomposition
- GitHub synchronization
- Basic agent system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (In Progress)
- Parallel execution optimization
- Advanced context management
- Performance monitoring
- Enhanced error handling

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration (Planned)
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Enhanced reporting and analytics
- Advanced agent capabilities
- Enterprise features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **GitHub API Changes**: Mitigated by using official GitHub CLI
- **Context Loss**: Mitigated by redundant local storage
- **Agent Conflicts**: Mitigated by Git-based coordination
- **Performance Issues**: Mitigated by efficient local operations

### Adoption Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Mitigated by comprehensive documentation
- **Workflow Disruption**: Mitigated by gradual rollout
- **Team Resistance**: Mitigated by clear value demonstration
- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigated by using existing GitHub workflows

## Timeline
- **Phase 1-2**: Complete (Current system)
- **Phase 3**: In Progress (Advanced features)
- **Phase 4**: Planning Stage (Enterprise features)

## Resources Required
- GitHub repository for project management
- Claude Code for AI assistance
- GitHub CLI for integration
- Development team for testing and feedback
